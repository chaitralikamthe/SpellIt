The game is designed to make learning fun for kids. Practicing spellings by writing or reading can be boring 
for kids. Kids love playing games and they can learn from it too with this game.
● Description – The inspiration came from a snake game we used to play, however with JAVA, I 
implemented ArrayList to modify it into a spelling game.
